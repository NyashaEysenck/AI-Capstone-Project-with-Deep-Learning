AI Capstone Project with Deep Learning
 
This repository contains the notebooks and code for my AI Capstone Project with Deep Learning, completed as part of the Coursera specialization.

## Project Overview

The project involves using pretrained ResNet and VGG models to classify concrete images, comparing their performance, and achieving high accuracy on the test set.

## Notebooks

1. **01-Loading-Data.ipynb**: This notebook covers the loading of the dataset.
2. **02-Data-Preparation.ipynb**: This notebook includes data preprocessing steps.
3. **03-Training-ResNet.ipynb**: This notebook demonstrates the training of a pretrained ResNet model.
4. **04-Training-VGG.ipynb**: This notebook focuses on training a VGG model and comparing it with the ResNet model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Installation

To install the required packages, run:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Capstone-Project.git
cd AI-Capstone-Project
```

Run the notebooks in order to reproduce the results:

1. Load the data using `01-Loading-Data.ipynb`.
2. Prepare the data with `02-Data-Preparation.ipynb`.
3. Train the ResNet model with `03-Training-ResNet.ipynb`.
4. Train and compare the VGG model using `04-Training-VGG.ipynb`.

## Results

The comparison between the ResNet and VGG models shows that both models achieve high accuracy, with the ResNet model slightly outperforming the VGG model.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effective use of pretrained models for image classification tasks, highlighting the benefits of transfer learning and model comparison.
